## W16 Tell a Story with Visualization?

### What is “Sorytelling with Visualization”?

> Storytelling with visualization? It is like creating a roadmap for the mind. Just as a map uses symbols and paths to guide travelers toward their destination, a well-crafted visualization guides the audience through data, revealing insights step by step. The visuals act as landmarks that highlight key points, while the narrative is the journey that ties everything together. With each graph or chart, the audience moves closer to understanding the full picture, just as a traveler reaches their goal. A good story told with data visualization doesn’t just show information—it brings clarity and meaning. (透過視覺化進行故事敘述就像為心靈繪製一張地圖。正如地圖使用符號和路徑來引導旅行者到達目的地，一個精心設計的視覺化圖表引導觀眾逐步了解數據，揭示洞察力。視覺元素就像地圖上的地標，突出重要的資訊點，而敘事則是將所有內容聯繫起來的旅程。每個圖表或圖形讓觀眾更接近完整的理解，就像旅行者逐步到達目標。一個以數據視覺化講述的好故事不僅展示信息，還賦予其清晰度和意義。)
