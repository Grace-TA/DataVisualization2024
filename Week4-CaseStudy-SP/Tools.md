## Gantt Chart?

A Gantt chart is a visual project management tool that illustrates a project's timeline, tasks, and their dependencies. It uses horizontal bars to represent tasks, showing start and end dates, progress, and overlaps. Gantt charts help track project schedules, ensuring efficient task management and resource allocation.
