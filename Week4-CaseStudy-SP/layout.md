## Gantt Chart?

A Gantt chart is a visual project management tool that illustrates a project's timeline, tasks, and their dependencies. It uses horizontal bars to represent tasks, showing start and end dates, progress, and overlaps. Gantt charts help track project schedules, ensuring efficient task management and resource allocation.

### What is IELTS?

The IELTS (International English Language Testing System) is a globally recognized language proficiency test for non-native English speakers. It assesses four key language skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking. IELTS is commonly used for academic, professional, and immigration purposes, with two test types: Academic (for higher education) and General Training (for work or migration). Scores are given on a band scale from 1 to 9, reflecting a candidateâ€™s level of English proficiency. It is widely accepted by universities, employers, and governments worldwide.
