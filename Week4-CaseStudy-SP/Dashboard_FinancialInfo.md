### 1. Income Statement Waterfall? 
An Income Statement Waterfall is a financial presentation method that displays the components of an income statement step by step, often using a waterfall chart to show how each line item affects the overall financial performance of the company. It typically begins with revenue at the top and moves through various expenses (like cost of goods sold, operating expenses, taxes) until arriving at the net income (the "bottom line").

### 2.  Current Ratio?
The Current Ratio is a financial metric used to measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. It is one of the liquidity ratios that investors and creditors use to assess how well a company can pay off its current liabilities (debts due within one year) using its current assets (assets expected to be converted into cash within one year).

The formula for the Current Ratio is:

Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

* Current Assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets expected to be liquidated or used within a year.
* 
Current Liabilities are obligations the company needs to settle within a year, such as accounts payable, short-term loans, and other short-term debts.​
 
* Current Assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets expected to be liquidated or used within a year.
Current Liabilities are obligations the company needs to settle within a year, such as accounts payable, short-term loans, and other short-term debts.

### 3. Quick Ratio?
excludes inventory and prepaid expenses because these assets may take longer to convert into cash; therefore, the company has enough liquid assets to cover all of its current liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory.

Note: 速動比率 就像只計算錢包裡的 現金 來確定你是否有足夠的錢應付一天的開銷，而排除流動性較低的支付方式（如禮品卡或必須先出售的物品）。這能給你一個更清晰的判斷，了解你能否應對即時需求。

### 4. Gross Margin?

It's important to first understand its role in financial performance analysis. Gross Margin reflects the profitability of a company after deducting the direct costs associated with producing its goods or services (Cost of Goods Sold or COGS) from its revenue. We'll define the term, explain how it's calculated, and use a metaphor to make it easier to grasp. Then, we'll translate the explanation into Traditional Chinese.


### **What is Gross Margin?**

**Gross Margin** is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue a company retains after covering its **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**, which are the direct costs associated with producing goods or services. Gross Margin helps assess how efficiently a company produces its products and how much profit it can make before accounting for other operating expenses, taxes, and interest.

The formula for **Gross Margin** is:

Gross Margin, % = ( Revenue - COGS) / Revenue)   *  100


- **Revenue** represents the total sales made by the company.
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** includes direct costs like materials, labor, and manufacturing expenses that are necessary to produce the goods or services.


### 5. Debt-to-equity?
measures the relative proportion of a company's debt and equity used to finance its assets. It indicates how much debt a company is using compared to its shareholders' equity.

Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Equity / Total Liabilities
​
Note: 較高的比率表示公司依賴更多的債務，可能意味著風險較高；較低的比率則意味著公司依賴股本資金，資本結構較穩定。
 
### 6. Cash Conversion?
measures the time it takes for a company **to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales**.


Note: 較短的現金週轉週期表示公司能夠更快地將資源轉換為現金，這通常對於公司的流動性較有利；較長的週期可能表示公司在管理存貨、銷售或應付帳款方面效率較低。

### 7. Net Margin?

Shows the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest have been deducted. It reflects the overall profitability of a company.

Note: 淨利率 用來顯示公司在扣除所有費用、稅金及利息後，收入中剩餘的利潤百分比

### 8. Revenue Last Five Years?

This metric refers to a company’s total revenue over the last five years, usually presented year by year. Tracking revenue over a period helps in understanding the company's growth trends.

Note: 持續的收入增長表明公司對其產品或服務有穩定或上升的需求；收入下降可能表明市場挑戰、市場份額流失或管理不善。

### 9. Current/Quick Last Five Years?

Tracking these liquidity ratios over time helps assess the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations and how its liquidity position has evolved.

Note: 穩定或上升的比率表明公司維持或改善了其流動性；下降的比率可能顯示出公司流動性問題，使得公司更難以應對短期負債。
