# Dashboard Case Studies: Monitoring a Software Project

## Dashboard?
A **dashboard** is a user interface that provides a visual overview of key performance indicators (KPIs), data, and metrics, often in real-time, to help users monitor and analyze performance. Dashboards are commonly used in business, IT, and other fields to track progress, identify trends, and support decision-making. They typically include charts, graphs, and tables for intuitive data presentation. Dashboards can be customizable to meet the specific needs of users or organizations.

**儀表板**是一種使用者介面，提供關鍵績效指標（KPI）、數據和度量的視覺概覽，通常是即時更新，以幫助使用者監控和分析績效。儀表板常用於商業、資訊技術等領域，用來追蹤進展、識別趨勢，並支持決策。它們通常包括圖表、折線圖和表格，以直觀方式展示數據，並可根據使用者或組織的需求進行定制。

## Case Studies? 
A case study is an in-depth analysis of a specific real-world situation or problem to understand its complexities, identify solutions, and derive insights. It is commonly used in education, business, and research to illustrate practical applications of theories and foster critical thinking.

個案研究是對特定真實情境或問題的深入分析，旨在理解其複雜性、尋找解決方案並獲取見解。它廣泛應用於教育、商業和研究領域，以展示理論的實際應用並促進批判性思維。

## Monitoring?

Monitoring is the continuous process of tracking and assessing the performance, progress, or status of a system, project, or environment. It ensures that operations run smoothly, identifies issues in real-time, and supports timely decision-making to maintain efficiency and effectiveness.

監控是持續追蹤和評估系統、專案或環境性能、進度或狀態的過程。它確保運行順暢，及時發現問題，並支持迅速決策，以維持效率和效能。
