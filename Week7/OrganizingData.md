# Organizing Data for Dashboards

## A. What Is Data Cleaning? What Is Database?

### 1. Data Cleaning? Data cleaning is the process of improving data quality by detecting and correcting inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and errors in a dataset.

### 2. Database? The database is like a huge library, where all the information is neatly stored on the bookshelves and can be accessed at any time.

### 3. SQL? SQL (Structured Query Language) is the librarian. It understands the layout of the library, knows exactly where every book is, and can quickly fetch the information you need. With SQL, you can not only ask for specific data, but also update, remove, or organize the books on the shelves.
