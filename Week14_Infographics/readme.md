# DVBD2024 - Using Shapes to Create Infographics, W14 - W15

## A. What Is Inforgraphics? Shapes to Inforgraphics?

> Infographics are like a recipe book for complex information. Just as a recipe simplifies cooking by combining ingredients into an easy-to-follow format, infographics blend data, images, and design to make complex information digestible. They tell a visual story, guiding the audience step-by-step through data insights, just like how a recipe guides you to create a delicious dish. (資訊圖表就像是複雜信息的食譜書。正如食譜通過將食材簡化為易於遵循的格式來輔助烹飪，資訊圖表則結合了數據、圖像和設計，讓複雜的信息變得易於理解。它們透過視覺故事引導觀眾逐步了解數據的洞察，就像食譜引導你做出一道美味的菜餚一樣。)
